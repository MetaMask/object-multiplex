# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0]
### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Increase minimum Node.js version to 16 ([#41](https://github.com/MetaMask/object-multiplex/pull/41))
- **BREAKING**: Bump `readable-stream` from `^2.3.3` to `3.6.2` ([#41](https://github.com/MetaMask/object-multiplex/pull/41))

### Removed
- Remove dependency `end-of-stream` ([#41](https://github.com/MetaMask/object-multiplex/pull/41))
- Remove `stream-resolved.finished` overload in types ([#41](https://github.com/MetaMask/object-multiplex/pull/41))

## [1.3.0]
### Added
- Export TypeScript types ([#31](https://github.com/MetaMask/object-multiplex/pull/31))

## [1.2.0]
### Changed
- Throw error if parent is destroyed or ended already when creating sub streams ([#17](https://github.com/MetaMask/object-multiplex/pull/17), [#22](https://github.com/MetaMask/object-multiplex/pull/22))
  - Such streams would have failed after the first write anyway. This failure case should be easier to deal with now that we're identifying it earlier, with a more helpful error message.

### Added
- TypeScript typings ([#9](https://github.com/MetaMask/object-multiplex/pull/9))
